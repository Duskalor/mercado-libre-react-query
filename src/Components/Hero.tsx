        Where should I start <br /> Disjointed heart <br /> I've got no
        commitment <br />
        To my own flesh and blood <br /> Left all alone <br />
        Far from my home <br /> No one to hear me, <br />
        to heal my ill heart, I <br />
        Keep it locked up inside <br />
        Keep my distance from your lies <br />
        Cannot express <br />
        To the point I've regressed <br /> If anger's a gift, then <br />I guess
        I've been blessed, I <br />
        Keep it locked up inside <br /> Keep my distance from your lies <br />
        BREAK <br />
        ME <br />
        DOWN <br />
        By My Time Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Why) <br />
        Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (What)
        <br /> Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Why)
        <br /> Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Why) <br />
        Keep it locked up inside <br />
        Keep my distance from your lies <br />
        Keep it locked up inside
        <br />
        Stand up alone on outside??
